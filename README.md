# Weather-App
This is a simple and responsive weather app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data from a public API based on user input and displays temperature, weather conditions, location, and icons. Ideal for learning API integration, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch), and DOM manipulation in front-end projects.
